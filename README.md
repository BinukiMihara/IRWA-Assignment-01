Did a NLP task
Created a game called 'Quote Master' where the user needs to write a similar quote for a randomly given quote by the computer. The game measures similarity between quotes using a combination of TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity, and the user wins if the similarity is greater than 0.5. User wants to extend the game so that the user must input a similar quote within 15 seconds. If the user exceeds the time limit, they lose the game. If they input a quote but lose, a new quote will be provided, but the remaining time will carry over from the initial 15 seconds.
